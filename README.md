# TwitterCardInterface

In this project I will be making a Twitter Card Interface; something you get when you tap the three dots on top right side of user's profile. The card is simply a custom UIView and I am using UIPanGestureRecognizer to swipe the card up or down. 

UIPanGestureRecognizer gives options to execute code when the gesture begin, changes or ends.

The full tutorial post (Part 1) is available here:

In part 2 I will improve the UI further and include buttons / stackViews etc.
